# Volunity Archive

# Project summary


Volunity was a proposed application with the ultimate goal of connecting volunteers to nonprofit organizations. 

Development on the project began during the winter of 2020-01, and mostly took place in the summer of 2021 (right before we all went off to college.) The project was ultimately scrapped due to the business of college and feasibility concerns, but it nonetheless proved to be a fantastic learning experience.

# People and roles


- **Mick Tobin**, Head designer/strategist
- **Benjamin Gordon**, Head developer
- **Hamza Ishaque**, Assistant developer (wrote most of mobile/pages/Profile.js)

# Technologies used


**React Native** was used to create a mobile app frontend.

**React, Express, NodeJS,** and **Firebase** were used to create (something of a) full-stack website. 


# Disclaimers

This project was, first and foremost, a learning experience. A lot of the code in this repository, to put it bluntly, sucks. Some of it is sloppily written, some of it does not work, and some of it never would have worked. 

There is, however, great *value* in the code written for this project; it represents the outcome of countless hours of struggling and learning. Even if the project itself may have failed, the time we spent on it did not amount to nothing.
All of the React Native work I (Ben Gordon) have done since, especially in [HackTX 2021,](https://github.com/consilia-proj/consilia-mobile-app) could not have happened without Volunity preceding it.

The name Volunity was, to my knowledge, thought up by Mick Tobin independently. Any past usage by other parties is purely coincidental.

If any material in this repository is owned/copyrighted/trademarked by other parties, let me know and I will remove it.
